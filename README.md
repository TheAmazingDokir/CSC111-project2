Linking to Success: How Backlinks Affect SEO Performance of Websites

One of the challenges that website owners face is ranking high in search results. There are two main ways to raise
website recognition: through paid ads and through optimization of the website for search engines. The second ap-
proach is called SEO - Search Engine Optimization. Platforms like Google Analytics can provide general statistics
and advice on how to improve SEO performance (Google Search Central (2025). Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Starter Guide). There are many techniques, including picking the right keywords, optimizing metadata, adding site
maps, using appropriate headers (Michigan Tech University (2025). Five Ways to Improve Your Site’s Ranking
(SEO)). This project will be focusing on SEO through external links to and from the website.

Outbound links are hyperlinks that go from a particular website to an external website. Backlinks are links that
go from an external website to the current website.

There is some evidence that proper linking with other websites can enhance the SEO performance (Michigan Tech
University (2025). Five Ways to Improve Your Site’s Ranking (SEO)), however, it is not explored in detail how
effective it is or what factors to consider when adding links to other websites. Better understanding of how hyperlinks
affect search engine ranking can provide website owners with useful information on how to increase natural traffic
to the website. On the other hand, it can also detect if there are possible exploits of hyperlinking that are present
on the web nowadays. Our project also aims to provide insight into how the engagement on the different websites
that your website has an outbound or backlink to can affect engagement on your own website. Since there is no
transparent official documentation on how particular search engines like Google exactly work, obtaining empirical
evidence on how links affect the performance of the website can be of high importance for small software companies,
startups, and individuals who wants their website to be noticed by public, but are not interested in increasing their
traffic via artificial methods such as paid ads.

The research question of this project is: ”Can we predict the engagement and SEO performance of the
website based on the backlinks and outbound links of that website? ”
